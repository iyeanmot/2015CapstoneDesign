Arrow Waypointer
Version 1.0

Instructions for use:

1. Add the "Waypoint Arrow" prefab to your scene, you can set the prefab as a child of the camera object to ensure it's always within view of the camera.

2. Add the "Waypoint Controller" to your scene, set the number of waypoints used by adjusting the "Total Waypoints" value in the inspector.

3. Position the waypoints in your scene.

4. Adjust collider size of waypoints.

5. Add any additional components or gameobjects to your waypoint, such as visual indicators, so the player know that's where he/she needs to go.


Notes:

-When a collider with the tag "Player" collides with a waypoint, the current target changes to the next waypoint. 

-When the last waypoint is reached, the "Waypoint Arrow" and "Waypoint Controller" are destroyed.

-After adjusting the "Total Waypoints" value, if you have unused waypoints in your scene, you can just delete them.
